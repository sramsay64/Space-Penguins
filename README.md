# Space-Penguins

###### KSP + Bad Piggies + Multiplayer + www.kenney.nl + libGDX + Open Source = A cool game

This is an alpha game heavily inspired by both Kerbal Space Program and Bad Piggies. It uses the libGDX framework but currently only supports desktop. Most of the art is public domain art from [kenney.nl](http://kenney.nl) ([also here](http://opengameart.org/users/kenney)) with some extra stuff from [opengameart.org](http://opengameart.org). The end product should have various game modes, possibly including a [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)) mode.
